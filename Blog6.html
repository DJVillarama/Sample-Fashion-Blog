    <h1>Is the Suit Dying – The Role of Classic Menswear in Today’s World</h1>

<section class="content">

<h5 align="center">March 8, 2020</h5>
<p align="justify">As we enter the third decade of the 21st century, there’s been an 
increasing amount of scrutiny placed on that most quintessential of menswear ensembles, the s
uit. Where suits were the everyday professional attire of most of the Western world in the la
te 19th and through the 20th centuries, there have been seismic shifts in the last few decades 
in the world of professional attire. So, where does the suit stand today? Is it a relic of a b
ygone era or does it still have a role to play in the world of menswear?</p><br>

<h4 align="center">A Brief History of Suits</h4>
<p align="justify">In the 1940s everyday attire for most men was based on the suit. The typical 
price for a suit, at the time, was about $50 which averages to around $917 in today’s money. Text
ile manufacturing in the US was reaching its peak output around this time and the average America
n spent around 12% of their income on clothing. In this era, a man would buy a suit at an average
 of about one every two years or so. Not only would he wear his suits to the office but also in a
 wide variety of other locations. For example, to watch sporting events or sometimes, even to pla
 y sports.</p>
 
 <div class="container px-lg-5" align="center">
    <img src="image/Blog6pic1.jpg">
</div><br>

<p align="justify">If we look a decade earlier at the 1930s, everyone from famous movie stars to wo
rking men in breadlines were wearing suits almost daily. Through the first half of the 20th century,
 the suit was largely synonymous with broader ideas about the nature of masculinity and society but
 as the counterculture movement of the 1960s came into its own, there was large-scale rejection of th
 e traditions that had typified the earlier part of the century and this included menswear. And while 
 the suit has hung on and continued to evolve through the ensuing decades, there is still a greater emph
 asis placed on individuality and in particular, comfort in today’s fashions.</p><br>
 
 <h4 align="center">Suits In The Modern Era</h4>
<p align="justify">So we’re long past the days where most men are wearing suits every day and for almost 
any occasion but does this actually mean that the suit is on its way out?</p>
  <p align="justify">Today, evidence of a decline of menswear and really the apparel industry as a whol
  e is everywhere. In this graph from a recent article from Bloomberg entitled the Death of Clothing, yo
  u can see that apparel is quickly losing ground in terms of where consumers are spending their money t
  o technology and experiences.</p><br>
  
  <div class="container px-lg-5" align="center">
    <img src="image/Blog6pic2.jpg">
</div><br>
<p align="justify">Apparel stores of all kinds including those that claim to be the future of retail are 
closing. As an example, luxury department store, Barneys, has filed for bankruptcy and agreed to close al
l of its stores. Financial institutions like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs long considered bastions of for
mality, just think of the phrase “white collar,” are now relaxing their dress codes and American men are b
uying fewer suits, overall. Today, casual attire really is the new standard. As just one example, men can w
ear sneakers with just about any ensemble.</p>
 <p align="justify">The textile and apparel industries in America have almost completely disappeared and 
 high-level CEOs of multibillion-dollar corporations who now see the suit as being too stuffy have ditched 
 it for more contemporary looks. Think, for example, of people like Steve Jobs with his turtleneck sweaters 
 and Mark Zuckerberg with his trademark hoodies.</p><br>

 <div class="container px-lg-5" align="center">
    <img src="image/Blog6pic3.jpg">
</div><br>

<h4 align="center">The Power Suit</h4>
<p align="justify">It is important to note that there’s an element of socioeconomic status when deciding on
 dress codes. So, while a CEO may have the ability to decide what their own dress code will be, those workin
 below them might not have that same freedom. Also, this speaks to some degree about matters of personal valu
 e. If Mark Zuckerberg wants to wear the same thing every day so he can maximize his mental energies elsewher
 e, more power to him but you can still devote mental resources to your clothes if looking good is a priority
 to you and it should be but more on this later.</p><br>
 
 <div class="container px-lg-5" align="center">
    <img src="image/Blog6pic4.jpg">
</div><br>

<p align="justify">Far from the days when the average man would buy a suit every two years or so, today’s man 
buys fewer than one suit every 10 years and many men will only wear suits on specific special occasions such a
s weddings, funerals, and congressional testimony. Mentioning Mark Zuckerberg again, these images of Zuckerber
g making congressional testimony made headlines all over the world not just because of what he was saying but 
lso because of what he was wearing. However, different outlets had different responses to these images.</p>
<p align="justify">A piece from media outlet, Vox, on the supposed death of the suit argued that Zuckerberg t
rading in his hoodie for a suit spoke to the current status of the ensemble as a uniform for the powerless on
ly worn by those who are trying to appease those in positions of higher power than themselves. In the words of
 the author of the piece, Mark Dent, “unless you live on Park Avenue, the suit brings to mind job interviews, j
 unior salespeople, hotel clerks, and court appearances.”</p><br>
 
  <div class="container px-lg-5" align="center">
    <img src="image/Blog6pic5.jpg"><br>
</div><br>
<p align="justify">Meanwhile, the New York Times had a different take on the matter. According to their writer, 
Vanessa Friedman, Zuckerberg wearing a suit said to “suspicious, establishment lawmakers: I am in your house, I
 will accept your rules. It said I acknowledge the responsibility I bear and take this seriously. It acceded to t
 he general interpretation that this was a growing up moment, because in the iconography of clothing, the suit is t
 he costume of the grown-up, while the t-shirt is the costume of the teenager, the off-duty, the breaker of rules.”</p>

<p align="justify">While we agree with Dent’s take that the suit is strongly linked to power dynamics in professiona
l settings, we also agree with Friedman that while wearing a suit does say that you’re willing to play by a certain s
et of rules, the effect that the suit has on your appearance still creates a powerful visual statement. Despite the br
ader decline that we’re currently seeing in the apparel industry, clothes, at their core, can still have a powerful eff
ect on your image and your perceived identity. So while it may be the case that Mark Zuckerberg felt that he had to play
 by Congress’ rules in wearing a suit to his testimony, he also didn’t want to look the part of a smug teenager, he wante
 d to look like the CEO of a multi-billion dollar international company who was serious about why he was there that day.</p><br>
 
 <div class="container px-lg-5" align="center">
    <img src="image/Blog6pic6.jpg"><br>
<h4 align="center">Are Suits Still Needed In The Workplace?</h4>

<p align="justify">Expressions of power aside though, it is a valid question to ask whether we even have a need for suits as m
ore and more workplaces become increasingly casual. Let’s take Goldman Sachs and their recent change in dress code as an exampl
e here, according to author, Jay Fielden, in a piece for Esquire, “This doesn’t mean that all suits are dying. Instead, he argue
s that we’re only seeing the death of a type of suit, that blousey, droop shouldered, floppy lagged, body swallowing blue mass o
f fabric thing which has, for almost two decades, been the obligatory uniform of bank managers, politicians, and CEOs.</p>
 
 
 <p align="justify">What this look said on the behalf of its wearer is, “Whatever you do, don’t look at me.” In other words, wh
 at we may be witnessing now is the death of the conventional power suit which, as time has gone on, became less about power and 
 ironically, more about the lack of it, as we discussed earlier. To quote Fieldman again, “To think a suit is one thing is to mis
 understand what a suit is. Like a Swiss Army knife, it’s a multi-purpose tool.”</p><br>
 
 <h4 align="center">The New Role of The Suit</h4>
 <p align="justify">So if only the power suit is truly dying these days and suits, in general, are to take on a new role, what will
 that new role be? In our opinion, the suit is probably going to transition from being an expression of conformity to one of creativity.
 Fashion houses have, again, been increasing the number of suits and suit-inspired ensembles in their recent collections and creative suits
 have been a mainstay of red carpet looks for years. As another example, consider Justin Timberlake’s 2013 hit song, Suit and Tie, which he 
 performed on the accompanying tour wearing tailored Tom Ford suits.</p><br>
 
 <h4 align="center">Brock McGoff of The Modest Man in a burgundy suit from Indochino</h4><br>
 <div class="container px-lg-5" align="center">
    <img src="image/Blog6pic7.jpg"><br>
	
	<p align="justify">Off the red carpet, made-to-measure tailoring is becoming increasingly popular for the average man as it becomes mo
	re financially feasible. Think of brands like SuitSupply and Indochino who have brought the personal satisfaction that comes with customiz
	ed, if not necessarily fully bespoke garments to new audiences. All of this is to say that more men are now seeing the suit as a canvas f
	or personal expression.</p><br>
 
 <p align="justify">With that, there are two things to keep in mind here. First is that the suit has already evolved quite a bit since its ince
 ption in the late 19th century. Waistcoats are no longer a mandatory feature, lapels have widened and narrowed over time, silhouettes have chan
 ged and much more. The suit has evolved quite a bit over time and it has the potential to continue evolving. Secondly, the suit isn’t just an ac
 cessory that might fall in or out of fashion like a particular style of hat. Rather, a suit is a full ensemble and it’s supreme utility and versa
 tility have carved out a place in menswear that has made it a staple for over 150 years.</p><br>
 
 <h4 align="center">Accessorizing Suits</h4>
 <p align="justify">To add on to our earlier point about suits and personal expression, if you add accessories to a suit, you can, of course, create
 a variety of different looks that also speak to your own personal taste. Men in the early 20th century knew that even though most of them were broadly
 wearing suits as an overall uniform, they could work within that mold to still have subtle touches of personal identity.</p><br>
 
 <div class="container px-lg-5" align="center">
    <img src="image/Blog6pic8.jpg"><br>
 <h4 align="center">Brock McGoff of The Modest Man in a burgundy suit from Indochino</h4>
 <p align="justify">We, here at the Gentleman’s Gazette, believe that the so-called Golden Age of Tailored Menswear from about the 1920s to the 1960s
 contains looks that can still be leveraged today for maximum confidence and style but that doesn’t mean that we think our preferred aesthetic is the 
 only one that’s out there or the only one that can work best for a variety of different men.</p>
 <p align="justify">Suits have become something that many men wear only when absolutely necessary or when a clear corporate power dynamic exists but at
 the same time, as more companies continue to become more casual in terms of everyday dress and the suit leaves the workplace as a requirement, these old
 power dynamics may have the potential to fall away to a greater degree.</p>
 <p align="justify">In their place, the suit will be able to embrace a new role as a platform for personal and aesthetic expression either for those who
 wish to channel its history, as we do here at the Gentleman’s Gazette, or for those who want to take it in entirely new directions. In other words, the
 era of men having to wear suits may be ending but the era of men wanting to wear suits is just beginning. So, the suit is dead, long live the suit!  </p><br>
